          <h2>Hi! I'm Joanna Poon.</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a junior at  University of Southern California’s Iovine and
            Young Academy, majoring in Arts, Technology, and the Business of
            Innovation. Originally born and raised in the Silicon Valley of
            California, I moved just a few hours away to Los Angeles, California
            to pursue my college education. I started my career in UIUX design
            while in high school, looking for avenues to blend together my
            preexisting interests in design and experience with coding. From
            freelancing to in-house design teams at Samsung and Ernst & Young to
            design agencies like Work & Co, it has been quite a roller coaster.
