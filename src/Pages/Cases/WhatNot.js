          <p>
            After defining our stakeholder group and their motivations, we moved
            on to the design phase. Together with my fellow designers, Calix and
            Nicole, we each created a unique version of the remote, guided by
            our own interpretations of the guidelines we set.
          </p>

              <p className="tiny">My initial mocks</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            We all had very different versions of the remote, but we went back
            to the guidelines we had set in order to choose how to combine the
            designs. We loved Nicole's accessibility features, Calix's
            customizability, and my main interface. From there we made our
            second iteration of the remote.

            <div className="wrapMocks">

          <p>
            However, after asking for feedback from WhatNot and our users, we
            realized our design had <span className="bold">3 main flaws:</span>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>
                <em>Our interface was very flat.</em>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Since our main stakeholder group was the elderly, having a flat
                interface that doesn't mimic real physical buttons was
                backwards.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                <em>We didn't have a bid functionality.</em>
              </h3>
              <p>
                This was probably our biggest product flaw. The main purpose of
                WhatNot is bidding on products, but our remote didn't have a
                simple way to bid on these products.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                <em>We didn't consider the TV interface.</em>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Even if our main design in terms of functionality was within the
                remote, how the remote would interact with the TV was extremely
                important. Even if we didn't create a full prototype, a design
                would help understand the
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I want to note that at this point, the project had been over.
            Everything beyond this point was my work in order to improve the
            design we had made.
          </p>

          <div className="Subheader">
            <h4>New Interface:</h4>
          </div>

          <p>
            I first worked on fixing the interface. I added shadows and color
            blocking to make it feel more "physical". I also reworked the
            navigation, removing features that I deemed unecessary for the
            functionality of WhatNot TV, like the volume button and the ability
            to swipe through streams. I then added in the bid features, being
            able to bid a recommended amount quickly or write in a custom
            amount.

          </div>
          <div className="Subheader">
            <h4>Bid Functionality</h4>
          </div>

          <p>
            I then mocked out the bid functionality. I wanted to include a quick
            bid button since bidding can be a really fast process, while also
            having a custom bid button for those that want to bid a specific
            amount. This way, ease of use was prioritized while still allowing
            for customizability.

          </div>

          <p>
            My last big addition was the new TV mockup. I wanted it to have the
            same functionalities as the WhatNot streaming app so as to keep the
            integrity of the app.

          <h3>1. Defining the product is vital.</h3>
          <p>
            One of our biggest mistakes was the lack of the bid button, which is the main functionality of the WhatNot stream. We were so focused on how we can make the design for our stakeholder group that we forgot to define the user motivation in the first place. A user story before designing is probably the most important part, and since we neglected that, our design showed reflected that flaw in our design process.

          <h3>2. Think from all directions.</h3>
          <p>
            When we were designing, we were zeroed in on the remote design, and  thus we forgot the entire TV interface when designing. Had we designed the TV interface in addition to the remote, we would've seen the major design flaw in not including the bidding button on the remote. Thinking through the entire ecosystem in play and designing every aspect to work together is incredibly helpful.
